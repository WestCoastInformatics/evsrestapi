/**
 * Matches concepts that are members of the given subset, e.g. every concept in CDISC SDTM
 * Terminology (C66830). A subset is itself a concept, and membership is an association from the
 * member to the subset: in NCIt, Concept_In_Subset (A8). So this is a {@link HasAssociation} whose
 * type is the terminology's membership association, read from {@link
 * TerminologyMetadata#getSubsetMember}.
 *
 * <p>The subset is given by its code or name, like any relationship's target.
 *
 * <p><b>Exploratory.</b> Combinations of subsets (in any of several, in all of them, in one but not
 * another) combine {@link InSubset}s with {@link Or}, {@link And}, and {@link Not}: each membership
 * is its own association entry, so combining per concept is correct.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the current search's {@code subset} parameter, this doesn't narrow a CDISC grouper
 * subset to members named "CDISC ...". That special case is business logic in {@code
 * OpenSearchServiceImpl}, left out until it's decided whether the query language should keep it.
