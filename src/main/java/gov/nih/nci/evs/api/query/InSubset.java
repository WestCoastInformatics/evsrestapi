/**
 * Matches concepts that are members of the given subsets, e.g. every concept in CDISC SDTM
 * Terminology (C66830). A subset is itself a concept, and membership is an association from the
 * member to the subset: in NCIt, Concept_In_Subset (A8). So this is a {@link HasAssociation} whose
 * type is the terminology's membership association, read from {@link
 * TerminologyMetadata#getSubsetMember}.
 *
 * <p>The subsets are a value match on the subset's code or name, like any relationship's target,
 * e.g. {@code new OneOf(Set.of(sdtm, send))} for members of either subset.
 *
 * <p><b>Exploratory.</b> Combinations other than "any of" (in all of several subsets, in one but
 * not another) combine {@link InSubset}s with {@link And} and {@link Not}: each membership is its
 * own association entry, so combining per concept is correct.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the current search's {@code subset} parameter, this doesn't narrow a CDISC grouper
 * subset to members named "CDISC ...". That special case is business logic in {@code
 * OpenSearchServiceImpl}, left out until it's decided whether the query language should keep it.
